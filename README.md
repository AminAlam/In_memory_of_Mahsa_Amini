# In memory of Mahsa Amini
Mahsa Amini was a 22 years old Iranian woman who traveled to Tehran for holidays. Morality Police arrested and beat her for not wearing a proper hijab. She went into a coma because of hard hits to her head, and after two days, she passed away.
Many women are arrested and annoyed by the Islamic Regime of Iran for not wearing a proper hijab every day in Iran. She is not the first victim of extreme violence and harassment by the Islamic Regime of Iran, and as long as this procedure is not changed, the same things will happen.
